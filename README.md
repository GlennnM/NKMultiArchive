# NKMultiArchive
Simple mod for Ninja Kiwi Archive which allows multiple of the same game, from the same launcher.<br>
2025 update: also allows you to open games marked as 'unplayable' by NK (atm Battles, BMC, Beatstreak3000). Note that BMC is experiencing server outages which currently make it not playable as of May 2025. NK has said they are trying to fix these.<br>
<h>**Installing:**</h><br>
To install, open the newest release page(try <a href=https://github.com/GlennnM/NKMultiArchive/releases/latest>here</a>) and download MultiArchive.ps1, then run the script.<br><br>
Since all the script does is check for common installation directories and extract an app.asar file there, you can also install manually:<br>
1. find the installation directory, then navigate to the "resources" folder(it should contain app.asar)<br>
2. download and extract app_steam.zip or app_standalone.zip from the releases page depending on which archive version you use<br>
3. replace the app.asar there with the one from inside the zip file<br>

<h>**Uninstalling:**</h><br>
To revert the mod, reinstall the Ninja Kiwi Archive, or verify integrity of game files on steam.<br> If you saved the old app.asar you can also just replace it with that<br>
